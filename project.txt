--Const is just something like a fact: a0
data Const = Const String

-- Rule is some 'c0' with list of facts
data Rule = Rule String [Const]

-- the program should contain either
-- rules or facts so this doesn't work..
type Program = [Const]

-- 'a0'
consta0 = Const "a0"

-- program = [facta0, rule1]
